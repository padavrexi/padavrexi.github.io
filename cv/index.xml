      <description>Professional services architect at UniSystems November 2019 - present
As a result of the above and in conjunction with the experience I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered from all my previous positions, my title was changed to &amp;ldquo;Architect&amp;rdquo;. Along with it, my main focus has also shifted mostly towards automation/orchestration and cloud projects for large entities (EU institutions, banks, public sector). In short, I&amp;rsquo;m spending more time in front of VSCode and Azure portal instead of SecureCRT and WireShark.</description>
